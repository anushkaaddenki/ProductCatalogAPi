# Product Catalog API
This is a RESTful API built with Laravel for managing a product catalog. The API provides endpoints for managing products and categories, supports API versioning, implements caching for performance optimization, and applies rate limiting for security.
# Features
CRUD operations for Products and Categories
Repository Pattern for clean architecture
API Versioning (e.g., /api/v1/products)
Caching (for product/category lists)
Rate Limiting (prevents abuse)

# Repository Pattern
The API uses the repository pattern for better maintainability. The repositories are located in app/Repositories.
ProductRepositoryInterface defines methods for accessing product data.
ProductRepository implements the interface and interacts with the database.


# API Versioning
API routes are prefixed with /api/v1/
  routes/api.php


 # Caching
Laravel's caching mechanism is used for frequently accessed data. The products list is cached for 60 minutes to reduce database queries.


# Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is configured using Laravel's built-in throttling middleware. The default limit is set to 60 requests per minute.
